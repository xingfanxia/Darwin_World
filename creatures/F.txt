Inspired by the legendary battle technique of the ancient Greeks, Phalanx has a roving mode and a stationary mode.  It hops forward, occasionally turning left, infecting when possible and turning when it hits a wall.  When it infects or hits family it becomes stationary, building a phalanx and turning and attacking.  It will occasionally exit stationary mode to resume hunting.

The Phalanx species was bred and trained by Sean 'The Spartan' Beckwith.
