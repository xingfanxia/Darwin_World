   The WorldGraph class creates the actual "physical" world as a graph where each cell in the 
   theoretical world grid is represented as a Vertex and edges between vertices represent a connected
   path that may be followed by Creatures from one to another.  Creatures can only move in the 4 
   cardinal directions north, south, east, and west (or up, down, left, and right), they may not move
   diagonally.  They also may not move through walls, either the external walls of the grid or the 
   internal walls that are added. Therefore if there is a wall between 2 cells of the grid there should
   NOT be an edge between the 2 corresponding vertices.
